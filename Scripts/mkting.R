#' ### Proposed Marketing Strategy A: What and How to Promote  

#' The survey shows:  

#'   * Unable to fall asleep quickly (within 20 minutes) might be a result of stress.  
#'   * Healthy sleep (i.e. fall asleep faster and sleep more soundly) may be related to
#' the amount of calories burned and inactive time.  In other words, exercise might
#' be a way for healthy sleep.  
#' 
#' **Implications:**  
#' Bellabeat may consider to focus on promoting the benefits of exercise among
#' the public (mental health, reduce stress, help to sleep better) for the following
#' reasons:
#'        
#'   * The increase of mental health awareness among the public.
#'   * Both Naomi Osaka and Simone Biles withdrew from competitions because of 
#' mental health concern. Therefore, mental health is an important health issue 
#' that everybody should take care of. 
#'   * The lockdown resulted from pandemic have worsened the situation, sepecially among Gen Z.
#'   * The 2020 Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games might motivate people to exercise.        
#' 
#' **Marketing:**
#'     
#'   * Work with mental health organizations to promote the importance and benefits
#' of exercise.
#'   * Work with atheletes to promote exercises.
#'   * Adopt the user generated content strategy. Encourage Bellabeat users to
#' create and post their exercise-related videos on Bellabeat Wellness YouTube.
#'   * Promote Bellabeat Leaf in the market because its functions will meet modern
#' life’s needs:
#'      + Alleviate stress: Mindfulness tracking and Stress resistance insights
#'      + Encourage exercises: Activity tracking and Inactive alerts
#'      + Monitor sleep pattern: Sleep tracking  
#'      
#' ### Proposed Marketing Strategy B: Who, When and Where to Promote  

#' Two observations regarding exercising patterns:  
#'   1. On Saturday, respondents were willing to exercise more, regardless of 
#' distance or intensity. As the week passed, respondents started to lose their momentum.    
#' **Implications:**  
#' Bellabeat could stress the importance of persistence and consistency.  
#' Bellabeat’s mobile health tracking devices could help people to acheive 
#' those objectives effectively.  
#'   
#'   2. The most common workout period is from 5pm to 7 pm and followed by 12 pm to 1pm.
#' It is very likely that the survey respondents were office workers who did workouts 
#' after work and during the lunch break.

#' Implications: Office workers is likely to be the target group for Bellabeat.    
#'
#' **Marketing:**
#' 
#'   * Bellabeat could promote its mobile health tracking devices by launching 
#' Bellabeat video ad on the digital screens in the gym during the lunch time and
#' after work hours.
#'   * Bellabeat could organize community and provide health tips, athlete talks,
#' new exercise trends, new products, exercise challenges, etc. to raise loyalty
#'  among users.
